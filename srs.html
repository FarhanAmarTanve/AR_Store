  </div>
  <h2>
      <b>
            2.1 Product Overview
      </b>
</h2>
<p>
      Our system consists of an online furniture shopping which includes an extra feature called live view. This live view feature acts as a medium between our app and the web. This will allow the buyers/users to see the product virtually on their mobile/tablet devices using the camera function projecting an image of the product on the screen which they can adjust as they like. Each user can add products form their shopping cart and drag it to the display screen. 
</p>

<h2>
      <b>
            2.2 Product Functionality
      </b>
</h2>
<p>
     The major function of our project is to create an online furniture store which allows user to
      login to the page to gain access to feature like live view. This feature allows users to use our
      app on the phone to not only customise the product but also see their creation in a 3-
      dimensional environment like their surroundings on their devices and allowing them to add even
      more product in that environment.

  <h2>
      <b>
            4.1	Performance Requirements
      </b>
</h2>
<p>
      System’s visual must run smoothly without any latency to keep the level of immersion high. This requirement is depended on many aspects of the user mobile device/tablet. System will be developed by using Unity3D and Vuforia; therefore, versions of Unity3D and Vuforia must support the mobile devices’/tablets’ OS. Unity3D version must be the latest version (2017.2+). For Vuforia to be worked on mobile devices/tablets; Android OS must be 4.1.x+, IOS must be 9+.
</p>

      </b>
</h2>
<h4><b>4.3.1 Portability</b>
</h4>
<p>
      Augmented Reality Based Continuous Onboarding Framework is designed for mobile devices/tablets using Unity3D and Vuforia. Unity3D supports many of the mobile devices/tablets, so system can be used mobile devices/tablets if their OS versions are supported.
</p>
<h4><b>4.3.2 Performance</b>
</h4>
<p>
      he distance between the camera and the image shall not be more than 0.5 meters to scan. Scan operation shall not be last more than 10 seconds.

</p>
<h4><b>4.3.3  Usability</b>
</h4>
<p>
      The usability should be as simple as possible since the screen of a mobile device is not big enough to place many information. New users are able to learn using the system in 5-15 minutes.
